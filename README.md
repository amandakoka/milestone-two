# Design 
## Design Choices 
The quiz was designed to have a simple and easy lay out. This is so users can focus on the actual game and flag without being distracted by any other elements on the page so they can fully focus. As well as, with a simple layout any user can play without diffuculties and are able to understand the game. 
## Colour 
The colour palette for this webiste was chosen to match the grey header image. A colour picker was used to pick a grey colour from the header image so it could be used for the website and so everything matches. I chose a simple clean layout and colours so the user can have an easy experience and so users aren't distracted by any colours on the page apart from the colours on the flag.

## Images 
All images of flags were taken from freepik.com by the user rawpixel.com that I have credited in the credits section.
## Fonts
I decided to keep a simple clean font to go with the simple clean theme of the game so I used one font throughout this game. I used the Lato font from google fonts because of its clean and simple look. 
## Structure 
The website is structured in a user-friendly and easy-to-use way. Upon arriving at the website the user is shown the game and the user can play straight away. The webiste consists of 2 pages:
- Homepage(the quiz)
- Contact us page(where users can contact with any concerns/questions)
