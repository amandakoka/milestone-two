# Design 
## Design Choices 
The World Flags quiz prioritizes a simple and clean layout to ensure users can immerse themselves in the quiz without unnecessary distractions. The primary goal is to create an engaging environment where users can focus on the challenge of identifying flags. By using a straightforward design, users can navigate effortlessly and concentrate on the quiz content. This design promotes accessibility and inclusivity, allowing a diverse audience to enjoy the game without complications.
## Colour 
The color palette for the website was carefully chosen to coordinate with the grey header image. To maintain visual coherence, a color picker tool was employed to extract a suitable grey shade from the header image. This approach makes sure that the colors blend smoothly across the entire website.The deliberate use of a simple color scheme aims to facilitate a smooth user experience, minimizing potential distractions and enabling users to concentrate on the vibrant colors of the flags displayed in the quiz.

## Fonts
Choosing the right font is important to maintaining the overall simplicity and cleanliness of the design. I opted for the Lato font from Google Fonts for its clean and modern aesthetic. This font enhances the readability of the quiz content, ensuring that users can easily comprehend text instructions, flag names, and any additional information provided during the quiz.

# Deployment

The World Flags Quiz project is deployed on GitHub Pages, providing a convenient way to showcase and access the quiz online. The following steps outline the deployment process:

1. **GitHub Repository:**
   - The project is stored in a GitHub repository, ensuring version control and collaboration.

2. **GitHub Pages:**
   - GitHub Pages is utilized for hosting the live version of the World Flags Quiz.
   - Navigate to the "Settings" tab in the GitHub repository.

3. **Source Branch:**
   - In the "Settings" tab, scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - Choose `main` from the branch menu. Select `root` from the folder menu and save. GitHub Pages will deploy the site.

4. **Deployment:**
   - After selecting the source branch, GitHub Pages will provide the URL where the live site is accessible.

5. **Live Site URL:**
   - The live version of the World Flags Quiz can be accessed at your GitHub Pages URL.

## Local Deployment

You can fork and clone the World Flags Quiz repository to deploy it locally:

**Forking the Repository:**

1. Log in or sign up to GitHub.
2. Find the repository for the World Flags Quiz.
3. Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner.

**Cloning the Repository:**

1. Log in or sign up to GitHub.
2. Find the repository for the World Flags Quiz.
3. Click on the "Code" button and select whether you would like to clone with HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and copy the link shown.
4. Open the terminal in your code editor and change the current working directory to the location you want to use for the cloned directory.
5. Type `git clone`, then paste the link you copied in step 3 and press Enter.

## Issues During Deployment

During deployment, some common issues might arise:

- **Configuration Errors:** Incorrect settings in GitHub Pages settings, such as choosing the wrong branch or folder for deployment.
  - **Solution:** Double-check your GitHub Pages settings in the repository "Settings" tab. Ensure you have selected the correct branch and root folder for deployment.

- **Build Failures:** If your project requires a build step (like compiling code, installing dependencies, etc.), errors during these processes can prevent successful deployment.
  - **Solution:** 
    1. Verify that your build script (`package.json`, etc.) is correctly configured.
    2. Check the build logs or console output for error messages to diagnose the issue.
    3. Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed (`npm install`, etc.).

- **Permissions:** If there are permission issues (e.g., trying to access a private repository without proper credentials), deployment can fail.
  - **Solution:** 
    1. Make sure you have the correct permissions to access the repository.
    2. If deploying to a private repository, ensure your SSH keys or access tokens are set up correctly.
    3. Check repository settings to ensure you have the necessary access.

- **Cache Issues:** Sometimes old cached files can cause issues with the deployed site. Clearing the cache or doing a hard reload can resolve this.
  - **Solution:** 
    1. Clear your browser cache or use a private browsing window to test the site.
    2. If deploying to GitHub Pages, you can force a cache refresh by appending a query string to your URLs (e.g., `?v=2`).

## Justification for GitHub Pages Deployment

I have chosen to deploy the World Flags Quiz project on GitHub Pages for several reasons:

- **Free Hosting:** GitHub Pages is free to use, which is beneficial for open-source projects or personal websites.
- **Integration with GitHub:** As the project is already hosted on GitHub, deploying it to GitHub Pages is straightforward and integrates well with existing workflows.
- **Automatic Deployment:** GitHub Pages automatically builds and deploys your site when you push to the selected branch, making it convenient.
- **Custom Domain Support:** GitHub Pages supports custom domains, allowing you to use your own domain name if needed.

This method of deployment is both convenient and efficient, providing a live version of the project with minimal setup and maintenance.
